## Documentation

**Lotus Wiki:** https://github.com/Mqzn/Lotus/wiki

## Requirements

This library depends mainly on the following :

- Java 17
- [Adventure Components](https://docs.advntr.dev/getting-started.html)
- [Paper API](https://docs.papermc.io/) (no longer required since Lotus v1.0.9) 

## Dependency

Lotus API is being hosted on jitpack. Here's an example on how to setup
Lotus dependency on your project.

**Note:** The current **latest version** is [1.1.3](https://github.com/Mqzn/Lotus/releases/tag/1.1.3)

### Gradle

If you're using Gradle as your build tool for your project, this is quick example how to add it as a dependency in
your `build.gradle` file

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.Mqzn:Lotus:VERSION'
}
```

### Maven

if you're using maven, it's basically the same information regarding the API dependency but there will be small changes
to the syntax as following:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.mqzn</groupId>
    <artifactId>Lotus</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage/Examples

There are currently no real examples, but you can be the first to contribute to the project by using the api to create
examples for other to be inspired by.
